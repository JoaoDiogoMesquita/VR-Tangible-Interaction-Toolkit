## Task List

[A-Frame Tutorial](Tutorial.md)

### Task Set 1 ([Shake Detector Component](https://github.com/JoaoDiogoMesquita/VR-Tangible-Interaction-Toolkit/tree/master/Shake%20detector))

- Run the HMTL code and explore the environment.
- Use the Shake detector component in the object 'box1' without parameters.
- Personalize the component behaviour with the parameters in the table so the component can detect the shake movement.
- As de debug is set as True, open the programmer console of your browser to see the prints.

| Parameter | Value | 
| --------- | ------ | 
| switchInterval| 2000|
|minimumSwitchTimes | 2 |
|minimumDistance | 1  |
|axis | y |
|debug | True |

- Code: [Task Set 1](Task Set1)
- Note: The code is already prepared to make the object 'box1' shake. The final objective is to make the component detect this movement.
#
### Task Set 2 ([Button Component](https://github.com/JoaoDiogoMesquita/VR-Tangible-Interaction-Toolkit/tree/master/Button))

- Run the HMTL code and explore the environment.
- Use the Button detector component in the object 'button' with 'ref' as reference.
- Use the event to change the color of the object 'box' to blue.

| Parameter | Value | 
| --------- | ------ | 
| reference | ref |
| minimumTime |  500 |
| debug |  true |

- Code: [Task Set 2](Task Set 2)
- Note: The code is already prepared to make the object 'button' turn invisible after 2 seconds and turn visible again after 4 seconds. The final objective is to make the component detect this interaction.
#
### Task Set 3 ([Swipe Detector Component](https://github.com/JoaoDiogoMesquita/VR-Tangible-Interaction-Toolkit/tree/master/Swipe))

- Run the HMTL code and explore the environment.
- Use the Swipe detector component in the object <a-scene> without a reference and with the parameters in the table.
- Personalize the component behaviour with the parameters in the table.
- The interaction is not being detected and event emitted. Try to find out why and resolve it.
- Turn the object 'sphere1' color to red if sequence 1 is detected, and green in case of sequence 2.

| Parameter | Value | 
| --------- | ------ | 
| markers| #box1,#box2,#box3 |
| eventTargets | #sphere1 |
| sequences |  1 2 3,3 2 1 |
| maximumTime | 200 |
| hasReference |  false |
| debug |  true |

- Code: [Task Set 3](Task Set 3)
- Note: The code is already prepared to make a set of box objects to work as markers and disapear in sequence for some time like in the swipe interaction. The final objective is to make the component detect this interaction.
#
### Task Set 4 ([Angle Detector Component](https://github.com/JoaoDiogoMesquita/VR-Tangible-Interaction-Toolkit/tree/master/Angle%20detector))

- Run the HMTL code and explore the environment.
- Use the Angle detector component in the object 'box1' with parameters of your choose.
- If the interaction is not being detected, use the component behaviour with the parameters in the table.
- Change the script code to increment the z variable case the event is related to a 'positive' rotation and decrement in case of a 'negative' rotation.

| Parameter | Value | 
| --------- | ------ | 
| threshold| 20 |
| eventTargets | #sphere1 |
| axis |  z |
| debug |  true |

- Code: [Task Set 4](Task Set 4)
- Note: The code is already prepared to make a the 'box1' rotate 180ยบ in z axis.
