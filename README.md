# VR Tangible Interaction Toolkit
For [A-Frame](https://aframe.io).

This toolkit is a family of components that aims to assist the development of virtual reality experiences for situations where standard controllers are not available, are not the most suitable for interaction tasks, or simply to provide a different user experience.

The goal is for this to be used with fiducial markers detected through a Javascript library that allows it. With controlled detection of the markers, interactions can be made using the components of the A-Frame Javascript library and included in a variety of VR experiences.
